1) Download and install AVR Studio:
	- http://www.atmel.com/tools/STUDIOARCHIVE.aspx


2) Plug in the AVRISP mkII programmer via USB
	- ensure it is recognized by the operating system.


3) Plug in the PVED via USB
	- ensure it is recognized by the operating system.


4) Connect the programming cable of the AVRISP mkII to the PVED via a programming header
	- see schematic


5) Open AVR Studio and select "Tools" -> "Program AVR" -> "Connect..."


6) Choose AVRISP mkII in the list and click "Connect..."


7) Select the "HW Settings" tab
	- ensure the device is receiving the proper voltage (5 volts)


8) Select the "Main" tab
	- ensure "ATmega328P" is selected in the dropdown list
	- click "Read Signature" and ensure the signature matches ATmega328P


9) Select the "Program" tab and program the device
	- enter the path of PVED.elf in the "ELF Production File Format" section
	- click "Program"
	- a progress bar should indicate when programming is completed


10) Select the "Fuses" tab
	- programming the .ELF file should have programmed the fuses
	- read the fuses and ensure "CKDIV8" is UN-checked


11) Connect to PVED via serial using Tera Term or similar
	- check Device Manager for COM port number
	- use 9600 baud, 8-N-1
	- hit enter to get PVED out of idle state
	- you should see a login prompt

12) Attack the device
	- use Saleae and Bus Pirate
	- recover plaintexts
